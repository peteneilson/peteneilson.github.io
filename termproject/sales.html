            <p> <strong>EVIL The CALLING</strong></p>

            <h3><p>HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR CALLING</p></h3>

            <p>Have you ever wanted a bike that wasn’t like a bike at all? More like your favourite snowboard, or your funnest surfboard, the one that catches all the waves or trashes [pillow] lines faster than Kate Moss in the '90s. The Calling is your answer. This bike-shaped-skateboard has enough travel to keep you honest, while encouraging you to irresponsibly hit every extra-credit line on the trail.</p>

            <p>At this juncture most bike companies would drive in some high-scoring-scrabble words like optimized, nimble or anti-squat technology. But we won’t insult you with that nonsense. The Calling has all the bits and bobs you have come to expect from Evil, and water bottle mounts.</p>

            <p>The Calling is the Following's delinquent little brother that left on a road trip and never  returned, that pedaled into the night in search of more, then woke for the sunrise mission to the summit.</p>


            <p>The Calling is the trails, it’s the road trips, it’s the little side hits on the way, it’s the all-day pedal-fests, the backyard pallet sessions, the pre-work rip, the “I’ll get it this time”, the stories told later in the bar with your best mates, it’s 130mm travel, it’s Super Deluxe, it’s 27.5 or 26+, it’s boost.</p>

            <p> Price: $5,699 </p>

            <p> <strong>Santa Cruz 5010</strong></p>

            <h3><p>The thrasher's all-terrain play machine.</p></h3>

            <p>The 5010 is the most fun you can have on two off-road wheels, and Danny MacAskill’s wee bike of choice. Turning trails into pumptracks and logs into launches this bike begs to spend as much time above the ground as on it.</p>

            <p>A laser sharp, agile trail whip that turns on a dime and loves to pop and play. The 130mm-travel 5010 sports short chainstays and a low BB for a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, technical climbs. When it’s time to descend, the bike’s 66.2/66.5-degree head tube angle (adjusted via flip chip) and generous reach/short stem combo equate to precise, confident handling.</p>

            <p>This short-travel pocket rocket is packaged to be fast and nimble yet tough enough to take a beating. From dirt to rocky tech, 4X to BMX, this bike doesn’t give a XXXX what you do with it.</p>


            <p>The 5010’s balance and poise takes riders from uncertain neophyte to fledging flyboy. While some bikes are good at going up and down the 5010 is a bike that’s great at going up, down, left, right, triangle, square, up, up, up and away!</p>

            <p>The upper-link driven shock VPP suspension is configured to be sharp and responsive. A firm beginning stroke makes for a responsive, snappy pedaling and provides support for small bump, bump-jump playfulness, while the progressive curve offers the bottom-out resistance to make it feel like there’s a lot more travel than there actually is.</p>

            <p>There’s also more than enough tire clearance to run just about any size tire. We spec a variety of tire/rim combos, including 2.6-inch tires on Reserve 37 rims because we feel it’s the sweet spot of rock crawling traction and sportiness, but there’s room to run 2.8-inch tires if that’s your thing.</p>

            <p> Price from: $2,699 </p>

            <p>TWO DISTINCT CARBON FIBER FRAME BUILDS OFFER A BALANCE BETWEEN WEIGHT AND PERFORMANCE.</p>

            <p>TURQ Series bikes are made with the highest quality carbon fiber available and offer the perfect balance of stiffness and compliance. The result is a bike that feels smooth, solid and aggressive. CARBON series have small changes in the carbon fiber allowing for a more aggressively priced high-performance frame while maintaining strength and stiffness of its higher end sibling.</p>

            <p>LAB TESTED TO OUR MOST RIGOROUS STANDARDS AND PROVEN HERE ON THE TRAIL.
                The SB6 is tested under heightened frame requirements to withstand more abuse. What does this mean? Well it is tested to stiffness and impact levels of downhill bike standards. Along with the testing in the lab the SB6 has been ridden to victory on the toughest Enduro race courses in the world. This thing is Richie Rude frigging approved.</p>

            <p> Price: $4,999 </p>
